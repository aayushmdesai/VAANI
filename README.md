# VAANI

This system discusses an application of hand gesture recognition using computer vision technology to establish a system in places 
such as passport and visa offices. 
In the past two decades, researches have established numerous attempts, both theoretical and practical, to improve 
and enhance hand gesture recognition. 
Various conventions such as the American Sign Language (ASL), Indian Sign Language (ISL) and the British Sign Language (BSL) have 
been implemented in order to make this technology more feasible for the deaf and mute. 
Recent introduction of technologies such as deep learning, Convolution Neural Networks, etc. have completely revolutionized gesture 
recognition. With lesser amount of data and lesser processing cost, accurate models are trained leading to flawless system. 
The name of this system is VAANI (meaning ‘speech’ in Hindi). 

VAANI uses predefined datasets and CNN models in order to translate the input signs into equivalent text output. 
The system also contains a portal which provides a lot of functionalities such as information management and dataset upgrade. 
The system uses the real time inputs coming in from the user, the model is then fed with the input and the output is shown on the screen 
to the interviewer/employee who is conducting the interview.
